# Hopeful - A First Programming Language

My project, Hopeful - A First Programming Language, will involve the development of a programming language. This language will be aimed at beginning programmers in a university setting. It will have a simple and clean syntax that will allow students to focus on the fundamentals of programming, instead of a complicated syntax. Teaching programming to beginners can be a very difficult task. This project aims to create a programming language that will both help lecturers to teach and students to learn.
