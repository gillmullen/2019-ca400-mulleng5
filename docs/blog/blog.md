# Blog: Hopeful - A First Programming Language

Delay in beginning project as the ethics of surveying DCU students and staff. The solution was fill in an Ethics form, and to completely anonymise the data and collect no personal data from the participants.
Surveys have been drafted and proofread. Ethics form, Plain Language Statement, and Informed Consent Form has been completed and submitted.
Next step is to distribute surveys to the different demographics: beginning programmers, Engineering students, advanced programmers, and School of Computing staff. Once the surveys have been collected, they must be analysed.
Before the next meeting, I will complete the analysis. In the mean time, I will practice a run-through of the project with a very simple language, as to ensure that I completely understand what needs to be done.

Surveys have been collected, and the analysis on them completed.
Finer details of the language need to be decided. For example, will parameters be passed by value or reference, and will I include both arrays and lists in my language?
The next step is to write up a complete analysis of the data, and create a language definition. In order to help create a language definition, I will sketch out what my language should look like. Then, I will break my language down into sub languages. I am doing this as to not overwhelm myself with too much complex work at once.

Due to a brief illness, the analysis was not finished. The language definition is complete, with the exception of arrays. I have decided to only include arrays in my language, as I believe including both arrays and lists could be confusing to the student. I have also decided to use pass-by-value, as I believe it will be easier to understand for the students. I successfully broke my language down into a series of sub-languages which I will be working on for the next few weeks.
My goal for the next week is to complete the first three sub-languages and complete my analysis.
In terms of testing, I will write test for each sub-language. However, each language will also use the tests of the previous languages. For example, the second sub-language will use the second set of tests as well as the first.

## My Fourth Blog Entry

This week, I finished the write up of my analysis. I have mostly completed the first three sub-languages. The only things to be finished are the generating of executable LLVM, and some semantic checks in the third sub-language.
My goal for next week is to finish the semantic checks, LLVM, and creating a testing structure. I am also aiming to finish the fourth and fifth sub-languages.
